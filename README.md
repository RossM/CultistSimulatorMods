## About

This project contains mods for the game Cultist Simulator. Currently there are two mods:

* **AlwaysStack** stacks cards more aggressively: cards returned from actions, and cards done being exhausted, will stack with existing cards.
* **SnapToGrid** makes cards snap to a grid.

## Installation

First, you'll need to install the [Partiality launcher](https://github.com/PartialityModding/PartialityLauncher/blob/master/Tutorial.md). Follow the directions for that.
Then simply unzip the mod into your game's Mods directory (create it if it doesn't exist), and run the launcher.

Note: **You must enable 0Harmony** or the other mods will not work.
